# Swig & Go & C++

This is a sample project using [Go](https://go.dev/) with C++, combining them using [Swig](https://swig.org/).

There are two subfolders

 * `pal` contains a palindrome API written in C++
 * `rev` contains a string reverser written in C++

Both contain the Swig interface and simple Go unit tests.
